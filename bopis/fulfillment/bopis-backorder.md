# BOPIS backorder 

## Retailers should be able to take BOPIS orders for their out of stock products.

HotWax’s “BOPIS backorder” feature lets retailers capture BOPIS orders for out-of-stock products. All such BOPIS backorders are held in the store pick-up backorder parking and can be released for fulfillment and pick-up when their inventory arrives.

Products offered for pick-up may run out-of-stock before their planned future inventory arrives. Inability to accept BOPIS orders on the future inventory results in lost sales and reduced profit margins. Not displaying a product’s future availability also leads to unpredictable BOPIS experience. 

HotWax will display a “Pick-up when in stock” button and estimated pick-up date for products that can be picked-up but are currently not in stock. Once these products are restocked, they can be released for fulfillment and picked-up by customers based on their scheduled pick-up timelines. The ability to take orders on out-of-stock products also helps retailers to secure sales and ensure increased revenues.

Retailers using HotWax Commerce’s Backorder and BOPIS solutions may now implement the “BOPIS backorder” feature.
