# BOPIS backorder 

## Retailers should be able to take BOPIS orders for their out of stock products.

HotWax’s “BOPIS backorder” feature lets retailers capture BOPIS orders for out-of-stock products. All such BOPIS backorders are held in the store pick-up backorder parking and can be released for fulfillment and pick-up when their inventory arrives.

Products offered for pick-up may run out-of-stock before their planned future inventory arrives. Inability to accept BOPIS orders on the future inventory results in lost sales and reduced profit margins. Not displaying a product’s future availability also leads to unpredictable BOPIS experience. 

HotWax will display a “Pick-up when in stock” button and estimated pick-up date for products that can be picked-up but are currently not in stock. Once these products are restocked, they can be released for fulfillment and picked-up by customers based on their scheduled pick-up timelines. The ability to take orders on out-of-stock products also helps retailers to secure sales and ensure increased revenues.

Retailers using HotWax Commerce’s Backorder and BOPIS solutions may now implement the “BOPIS backorder” feature by customizing their PDP BOPIS experience to also factor backorder product availability.
