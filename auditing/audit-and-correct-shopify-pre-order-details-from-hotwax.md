# Audit and correct Shopify pre-order details from HotWax

## Merchants want the ability to monitor and correct Shopify’s pre-order items details for all Shopify stores from HotWax Commerce.

Merchants can audit the pre-order status across all Shopify stores as well as take corrective actions directly in HotWax. Readily verifying information ensures expedited rectification in case any inaccurate pre-order details are identified.

Verifying pre-order items status is essential as merchants may lose potential sales if an item expected to be available on pre-order is displayed as out of stock on eCommerce. Monitoring pre-order items status on Shopify requires users to copy the pre-order product IDs, search in Shopify and then check attributes like inventory policy, pre-order tag and metafield for each pre-order item. Merchants operating multiple Shopify stores need to repeat the process across all Shopify stores for each pre-order item, which takes an extended time.

Auditing and correcting Shopify pre-order details from HotWax will allow users to quickly pin down the pre-order item’s status without having to navigate to Shopify each time. Validating Shopify pre-order item details corresponding to HotWax pre-order for all stores will help make sure that systems are running in sync. Centralized view of all details will also ensure systematic management of pre-order items in HotWax.

Merchants can audit and correct pre-order items details right from the view product page in HotWax. An API call will be initiated to load the pre-order status of an item across all the Shopify stores.
