# App logs

## Error logs in apps help power users and developers evaluate and troubleshoot errors in apps.

While performing multiple operations, certain logics may fail to execute in a client side application, resulting in failed operations. HotWax Commerce now supports comprehensive logs visibility, allowing developers to easily locate exact error pathways and ensure fast debugging.

When an app's flow of operations breaks, HotWax support cannot identify what functions failed in a clientâ€™s app. If app logs cannot be retrieved from the servers, HotWax support is required to re-produce issues, which takes an extended period of time and may also result in inaccurate findings or issues not being re-produced.

App logs will allow HotWax support to determine what actions were taken within the app. Power users and developers can now pinpoint errors and quickly identify the cause of the issue. Transparency into detailed logs in the app and browser also allows for quick troubleshooting.

HotWax support may now access the error logs from apps and the browser.
